# Project Overview

## Problem Statement

In the projects for this course, I aimed to address various software development challenges involving data structures and program design. The primary objectives were as follows:

### Project One

In Project One, my task was to implement three essential data structures: a dynamic array (vector), a hash table, and a binary search tree. The core problem was to create these data structures and gain a deep understanding of their characteristics, including their runtime and memory complexity.

### Project Two

Project Two presented a distinct challenge: designing and implementing a Course Planning and Advising Assistance Program in C++. The objective was to develop a program that assists users in planning course schedules. This involved storing and managing course data within a data structure and providing functionalities for searching courses, printing schedules, and more.

## Approach

To tackle these challenges, I adopted a systematic approach, recognizing the significance of data structures in software development:

1. **Understanding Data Structures**: I delved into the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms to build a strong foundation. These structures were crucial for efficient data management and retrieval in the projects.

2. **Efficient Data Management**: I implemented the data structures, ensuring that they efficiently stored and managed data. Key considerations included runtime and memory efficiency.

## Overcoming Roadblocks

Throughout these projects, I encountered roadblocks that required effective problem-solving:

- **Problem Decomposition**: I divided complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks for easier resolution.
- **Seeking Help**: I actively sought assistance from online resources to overcome challenges(https://en.cppreference.com/).
- **Debugging**: I used debugging tools to identify and rectify issues in my code.
- **Reference Materials**: I referred to course materials and documentation to guide me through challenging sections.
- **Iterative Improvement**: I iteratively tested and enhanced my code, leveraging the power of continuous refinement.

These roadblocks provided valuable learning experiences and honed my problem-solving skills.

## Evolving Software Design and Development

My work on these projects significantly expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs in the following ways:

1. **Data Structures**: I gained a deeper understanding of the pivotal role data structures play in program performance, enabling me to make informed design choices.

2. **Algorithmic Thinking**: I developed a structured approach to solving problems, breaking them down into smaller steps and optimizing processes through algorithmic thinking.

3. **Code Organization**: Projects, especially Project Two, encouraged logical code organization, making it more maintainable and readable.

4. **Testing**: Rigorous testing and debugging became an integral part of my development process, ensuring the reliability and robustness of my software.

5. **Project Planning**: I learned to plan and structure larger software projects, considering requirements and user needs, which enhanced my project management skills.

## Writing Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Programs

The projects have positively impacted the way I write programs, promoting the development of maintainable, readable, and adaptable software through the following means:

1. **Modular Code**: I adopted modular programming practices, breaking code into smaller, reusable functions and classes, facilitating ease of maintenance and adaptability.

2. **Coding Standards**: I became more conscious of coding standards and style, resulting in more readable and industry-compliant code.

3. **Documentation**: Emphasizing the importance of documenting my code ensures that it is comprehensible to others and my future self, enhancing maintainability.

4. **Error Handling**: My error-handling and exception management strategies have improved, contributing to the robustness and reliability of my software.

5. **Adaptability**: Designing programs with adaptability in mind means they can be more easily extended or modified to meet changing requirements.

In summary, these projects have equipped me with valuable insights into efficient coding practices, data structures, and problem-solving techniques. These skills will undoubtedly serve me well as I continue to grow as a software developer.
